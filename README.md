2. Project Overview  

The flashcard app is a mobile application developed app that was created as part of an assignment in the IMAD module. This application was created using Kotlin and Android Studio. The app’s primary purpose is to help users quiz themselves by using flashcards. The app was developed to meet the requirements of the assignment, which includes creating a functional mobile app and utilizing GitHub for version control and CI/CD automation using GitHub Actions. 

  


3. App purpose and Features  

Purpose:  

The main goal of this app is for the user to answer flashcard questions based on history questions, score their responses, and get their results at the end. This app has 4 screens. The first screen is the main activity which is the home screen of the app next is the quiz activity which has all 5 flashcard questions next is the score activity which shows how many questions the user got correct the last screen is a review activity which shows all questions and the correct answers to all 5 questions 

 Key Features:  

 

- Feature 1: “Start Button” allows for the user to proceed to the next screen which show the flashcards.  

- Feature 2: “Score Text view” displays the score obtained by the user  

- Feature 3: “feedback Text view shows a comment based off the score that the user got 

- Feature 4: "Review Text view” shows all questions along with the correct answers to each question  

- Feature 5: “Restart button” goes back to the first flashcard question  

- Feature 6: “True Button” is one of the answer choices  

- Feature 7: “False button” is one of the answer choices 

- Feature 8: “Next button” proceeds to the next question 

- Feature 9: “Exit button” used to exit the program once the button is clicked on  

These features aim to provide quick and easy meal suggestions for people with busy schedules.   

  

 

Design Considerations  

 

The design of the flashcard app was based on the following considerations:  

User Experience (UX): The app was designed with the goal of providing an intuitive and easy-to-navigate user interface, ensuring a seamless user experience.  

Responsiveness: The app was built to ensure it performs well on different screen sizes, with particular attention to device compatibility.  

Simplicity: The design is minimalistic, focusing on core features without overwhelming the user.  

Performance: Code optimization was considered to ensure fast response times and low battery usage.  

Why:  

GitHub and GitHub Actions Utilization  

 

GitHub and GitHub Actions  

This project was managed using GitHub for version control, where all code changes were committed and pushed regularly. GitHub enabled collaborative coding, allowing me to keep track of changes and maintain project integrity.  

GitHub Actions:   

 

I utilized I utilized CI/CD action to automate the build and deployment process. This includes:   

Running automated tests to ensure the app’s functionality.  

Compiling the app into APK and AAB files, which are the formats that are required for distribution.  

I uploaded these build artifacts to GitHub for easy access. The workflow ensures that my project is automatically built and tested every time I push changes, and it simplifies the process of delivering the final APK/AAB files for submission.

Challenges and Learnings   

During the development of this project, I encountered several challenges, including:  

 

Challenge 1: “Connecting a device to Android Studio”  

Solution:” I connected the BlueStacks app to my android device and made sure it was connected on the run for BlueStacks application”   

Challenge 2: “Pushing my work from Android Studio to GitHub”  

 

Solution: “I used the Command Prompt and executed the commands that managed to push my work to GitHub”  

 

From these challenges, I learned important lessons in debugging, using version control, and automating build processes with GitHub Actions  

 

8.  Future Enhancements   

 While the current version of the app provides the core functionality, there are several features that could be added in the future, including:  

 

Feature 1: "Current date and time shown at the top”  

Feature 2: “Adding a different picture in the background to attract the user 

Feature 3: “adding more questions to the app”  

These enhancements would improve the app’s usability and make it even more versatile for end-users.
